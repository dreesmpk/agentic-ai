## DETAILED COMPANY REPORTS

### OpenAI

OpenAI faces mounting competitive pressure as its market leadership erodes. CEO Sam Altman declared a "code red" on Monday [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/836212/openai-code-red-chatgpt), signaling urgent organizational realignment in response to Google's Gemini 3 advancement.
