## COMMUNITY PULSE

The AI community is deeply divided over xAI's Grok deepfake controversy. On Hacker News and Reddit, users expressed alarm over the proliferation of non-consensual sexual deepfakes generated by Grok, particularly those depicting minors, with some calling for stronger safeguards and legal accountability. Critics argue that powerful generative tools like Grok amplify existing deepfake risks and demand robust detection and responsibility measures. Meanwhile, the broader investment community remains bullish on AI funding, with xAI's $20 billion raise and Anthropic's $10 billion round signaling continued investor confidence despite regulatory concerns. Tech observers note that major investors like Nvidia, Fidelity, and ARK Ventures are hedging their bets by backing multiple AI companies, suggesting a shift from winner-take-all dynamics to a more diversified AI landscape. Google DeepMind's achievement in surpassing OpenAI's ChatGPT has reinvigorated competition, with some commentators viewing it as evidence that the AI race remains wide open and that technical innovation can still shift market leadership. However, concerns about AI safety, deepfakes, and regulatory oversight are mounting, with governments in the UK, Malaysia, and India launching probes into Grok's capabilities.
