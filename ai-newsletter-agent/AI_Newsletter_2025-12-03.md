### Meta AI

Meta Platforms has announced a strategic shift to prohibit general-purpose AI chatbots—including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Perplexity AI—from operating through its WhatsApp application, forcing advertisers to rely exclusively on Meta's proprietary first-party AI for conversational engagement ([MediaPost](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/410910/whatsapp-gives-microsoft-openai-perplexity-the-b.html)). The move gives Meta complete control over user conversations within WhatsApp, enabling seamless integration of chat history into its ad-targeting systems for enhanced personalization and monetization. Users will not have the ability to transfer their WhatsApp chat history to competing platforms like Microsoft's Copilot app or website, further entrenching Meta's ecosystem lock-in strategy. This decision reflects Meta's broader effort to consolidate AI capabilities within its platform and maximize advertising revenue by controlling the data flow from user interactions.

### xAI

xAI employees are celebrating extreme work culture, with employee Parsa Tajik posting on social media that he worked approximately 36 hours without sleep at the company's office, departing after his marathon shift in his Tesla Cybertruck ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/xai-employees-work-life-balance-celebrate-36-hour-shift-2025-12)). Colleagues responded with celebratory comments, with one xAI employee sarcastically tweeting 'Work life balance is great, in-fact we recommend it to all our competitors,' reflecting the company's embrace of Elon Musk's 'hardcore' operational philosophy ([Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/xai-employees-work-life-balance-celebrate-36-hour-shift-2025-12)). This public celebration of extreme work hours is consistent with Musk's management style across his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, where long hours and high-intensity work environments are normalized and valorized as markers of commitment and excellence.

### Apple

Apple has named Amar Subramanya as its new Vice President of AI, replacing John Giannandrea in a leadership transition that signals potential dissatisfaction with the company's AI product execution ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/apple-names-amar-subramanya-new-vp-ai-replacing-john-giannandrea-2025-12-01/)). Subramanya joins Apple from Microsoft, where he most recently served as corporate vice president of AI, bringing enterprise AI expertise to a company that has lagged competitors like Samsung in rapidly deploying AI features to consumer devices ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/apple-names-amar-subramanya-new-vp-ai-replacing-john-giannandrea-2025-12-01/)). Reports indicate that Apple CEO Tim Cook has lost confidence in Giannandrea's ability to execute on product development, prompting the leadership change as the company seeks to accelerate its AI roadmap and close the gap with rivals who have been quicker to refresh devices with AI capabilities ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/apple-names-amar-subramanya-new-vp-ai-replacing-john-giannandrea-2025-12-01/)).

### DeepSeek

DeepSeek continues to establish itself as a competitive force in the global AI landscape, though specific product announcements from the company were not detailed in today's news cycle. However, the company remains a key player in the competitive dynamics between Chinese and Western AI developers, with industry observers noting DeepSeek's emergence as one of the leading AI labs alongside OpenAI and Google ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/02/mistral-unveils-new-ai-models-in-bid-to-compete-with-openai-google.html)).

French AI startup Mistral AI launched its new Mistral 3 family of open-weight models on Tuesday, comprising 10 models including a large frontier model with multimodal and multilingual capabilities designed to compete with closed-source models from OpenAI and Google ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/mistral-closes-in-on-big-ai-rivals-with-mistral-3-open-weight-frontier-and-small-models/)). The Mistral Large 3 frontier model catches up to important capabilities of larger closed-source models like OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's Gemini 2, while also trading blows with several open-weight competitors ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/mistral-closes-in-on-big-ai-rivals-with-mistral-3-open-weight-frontier-and-small-models/)). The release includes nine smaller offline-capable, fully customizable models designed to run on diverse hardware from cloud infrastructure to mobile devices ([CNET](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/these-new-ai-models-are-built-to-work-anywhere-in-many-languages/)). Mistral prioritized multilingual support by increasing the proportion of non-English training data relative to English, enabling better performance for speakers of all languages ([CNET](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/these-new-ai-models-are-built-to-work-anywhere-in-many-languages/)). The launch comes as Mistral, founded in 2023 and having raised €1.7 billion in September, positions itself as Europe's leading AI company competing with Silicon Valley's dominant players ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/02/mistral-unveils-new-ai-models-in-bid-to-compete-with-openai-google.html)).

### Perplexity

Perplexity AI faces significant competitive headwinds as Meta Platforms has prohibited the use of general-purpose AI chatbots—including Perplexity—through its WhatsApp application, effectively excluding the company from one of the world's largest messaging platforms ([MediaPost](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/410910/whatsapp-gives-microsoft-openai-perplexity-the-b.html)). This strategic move by Meta forces advertisers and users to rely exclusively on Meta's proprietary first-party AI for conversational engagement within WhatsApp, limiting Perplexity's ability to reach and engage users through one of the most widely used messaging applications globally. The exclusion reflects broader platform consolidation trends where major tech companies are prioritizing proprietary AI solutions over third-party competitors to maximize data control and advertising revenue.
